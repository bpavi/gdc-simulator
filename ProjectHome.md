Instead of maintaining centralized big data centers that rely on grid powers, using renewable energy(green power) to build small, distributed data centers is more competitive in many ways.

However, the unstability of green power also introduce many challanges to both system design
and management. Having a simulation result to support or challange your design before actually putting it into practice will be very helpful.

GDCSimulator is a software platform that is created to help researchers quickly implement and verify their ideas about distributed systems. It abstracts and hide many low level implementation details, enabling researchers to focus more on high level design features. In our research, it has been used to simulate wind/solar power based data centers, as well as looking for consistency models that best fits the need of green data center system.
